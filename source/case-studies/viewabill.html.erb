      Viewabill connects law firms with their clients to provide transparency and real-time invoicing.
      </p>

      <p>
      Cultivate were hired to build Viewabill, a product aimed at addressing the wide-spread problem of poor client/service provider relationships.  
      </p>

      <p>
      Cultivate were responsible for the complete engineering and visual design of the Viewbill web and iPhone applications. Cultivate integrated with many web-based hourly time tracking and billing systems and built a RESTful API allowing older client-server billing systems to push data to the service.
