    <h1>Our History</h1>
    <%= image_tag("history-line.png") %>
    <p>Cultivateâ€™s team were born from a common belief in fundamentally changing the way software consultancy is delivered. Previously Edgecase UK, the team were acquired to form the UK office of Neo (www.neo.com), a global product development studio.</p>
    <p>Neo brought together some of the best engineering and design consultancies to deliver Lean and Agile services to clients around the world.</p>
    <p>While Neo still operates under the brand name in the US and Singapore, Cultivate was born to focus on the UK market and continue to deliver world-class engineering, design and business strategy.</p>
