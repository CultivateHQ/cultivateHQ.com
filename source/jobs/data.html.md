# Recruitment data policy

## Source of Candidate Data

Currently we do not collect data from anyone other than the candidate. A candidate will only appear in our recruitment systems by initially emailing `careers@cultivatehq.com`.


## Data storage

Emails to`careers@cultivatehq.com` are received by all staff members in their [Google GSuite Mailbox](https://gsuite.google.com). Typically emails are archived but never deleted.

Those emails are also received by a custom recruitment [Trello](https://trello.com) board. Each candidate is represented by a single card on that board. The board is used to track a candidate's progress through our recruitment process. Subsequent emails and notes on conversations are added to this card.

A successful candidate's Trello card is deleted before they join.

An unsuccessful candidate's Trello card is deleted one year after the last recruitment interaction.

## Erasure procedure

Should a candidate wish to be erased from our system, they should get in touch via [careers@cultivatehq.com](mailto:careers@cultivatehq.com). They should tell us of the email addresses that they have used to communicate with us. We will

* Instruct current staff members to search and delete all emails to and from that candidate from their company email account
* Delete the candidate's Trello card

Note that staff members who leave Cultivate have their Cultivate email deleted.
