## Software Developer

To apply email [careers@cultivatehq.com](mailto:careers@cultivatehq.com) and tell us a bit about you.

### The Job

Are you a developer who wants to join a friendly team who care deeply about the quality of their work? If so, then we would love for you to [get in touch](mailto:careers@cultivatehq.com).

Technical capability is important to us. You will care about quality and strive for simplicity and maintainability in everything you produce. We often pair-program both internally and with client teams, so an ability to work collaboratively and share code ownership is essential.

Much of our work as a consultancy is in understanding the problem to be solved, so excellent "soft skills" are required. You will be curious, empathetic, respectful, honest and professional in your approach and interactions at all times.

### The Tech Stack

Most of our work is still in Ruby, but we have used Elixir in a number of projects in recent years and have a deep desire to do more. We have worked with, or have in interest in, other technologies such as Rust, Go, Scala, and Swift. On the front-end we've recently been favouring React.

### The process

We constantly iterate on our recruitment process. Currently it consists of two steps:

#### Initial pairing - 30 minutes

This can be in person or remotely using screen sharing. You will work on a small problem with one of our team.

#### Pair programming half-day

The final stage is pair programming with our developers at our Edinburgh office. Recruitment is a whole-team decision at Cultivate, and we find this the best way to get to know you.

### Equal-opportunities

We are an equal opportunities employer and value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, colour, national origin, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, marital status, or disability status.

### Salary range

Indicative salary range: £30,000 to £50,000 (depending on experience).
