## Software Developer

To apply email [careers@cultivatehq.com](mailto:careers@cultivatehq.com) and tell us a bit about you.

### The Job

Are you a developer who wants to join a friendly team who care deeply about the quality of their work? If so, then we would love for you to [get in touch](mailto:careers@cultivatehq.com).

Technical capability is important to us. You will care about quality and strive for simplicity and maintainability in everything you produce. We often pair-program both internally and with client teams, so an ability to work collaboratively and share code ownership is essential.

Much of our work as a consultancy is in understanding the problem to be solved, so excellent soft skills are required. You will be curious, empathetic, respectful, honest and professional in your approach and interactions at all times.

You will need to have the right to work in the UK.

### Our Tech Stack

Our work is still predominantly in Ruby (Rails), but we use Elixir on a number of projects and are actively looking for opportunities to do more. We also work with, or are interested in, many other languages including Rust, Go, Scala, and Swift. On the front-end we've been favouring React.

### The process

We regularly evolve our recruitment approach. Currently it's a two step process:

#### Initial pairing - 30 minutes

This can be in person or remotely using screen sharing. You will work on a small problem with one of our team.

#### Pair programming half-day

The final stage is pair programming with our developers at our Edinburgh office. Recruitment is a whole-team decision at Cultivate, and we find this the best way to get to know you.

### Equal-opportunities

We are an equal opportunities employer and value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, colour, national origin, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, marital status, or disability status.

### Salary range

Indicative salary range: £30,000 to £50,000 (depending on experience) + 5% pension contribution. Twice a year, 20% of profits are shared among the staff.
