## Software Developer

To apply email [careers@cultivatehq.com](mailto:careers@cultivatehq.com) and tell us a bit about you.

### The Job

At Cultivate we bring together technical excellence with empathy, honesty and collaboration to deliver world class solutions for our clients. We often pair program both internally and with client teams, using Test Driven Development to solve challenging problems whilst delivering high quality code that is simple and maintainable. As a consultancy, much of our work is in collaboratively understanding the problem to be solved, so excellent soft skills are important.

Our work is rich and varied, you could be working on anything from a new microservice to making a user interface for Marty the Robot.

If you are enthusiastic, curious, empathetic and looking for somewhere that you will be constantly learning and working on complex, engaging challenges with a highly skilled and friendly team then [get in touch](mailto:careers@cultivatehq.com).

You will need to have the right to work in the UK.

### Our Tech Stack

We're looking for individuals who aspire to continually improve and learn, so regardless of your background we would love to [hear from you](mailto:careers@cultivatehq.com).

Our work is still predominantly in Ruby (Rails), but we use Elixir on a number of projects and are actively looking for opportunities to do more. We also work with, or are interested in, many other languages including Rust, Go, Scala, and Swift. On the front-end we've been favouring React.

### The process

Our interviews are designed to showcase your ability to think through problems, write code to a high standard and work with other members of the team. A large part of your time will be spent pairing with other members of the team, so it's essential that you are comfortable with this way of working and that you get to meet members of the team to see if we are a good fit for each other.

#### Initial pairing

You will meet a member of the team for a short chat to answer any questions you may have, then work on a small problem, usually in Ruby, in an editor such as Visual Studio Code. This can be in person or remotely using screen sharing.

#### Pair programming half-day

The final stage is pair programming with our developers and designers at the Edinburgh office. Recruitment is a whole-team decision at Cultivate, and we find this the best way to get to know you and let you get to know us.

### Equal-opportunities

We are an equal opportunities employer and value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, colour, national origin, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, marital status, or disability status.

### Salary range

Indicative salary range: £30,000 to £50,000 (depending on experience) + 5% pension contribution + profit share scheme (in which employees share 20% of the profits, twice a year).
