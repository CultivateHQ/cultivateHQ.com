      <h2>A long term supporting role</h2>
      <p>Cultivate were originally engaged to update a single tool, with the opportunity to provide ongoing support on other projects based on our heritage within Agile, Lean UX and Ruby on Rails.  We worked hard from the beginning to create a transparent and collaborative partnership with The Money Advice Service’s (MAS) internal team. This has proven a valuable foundation – two years and many projects later, we continue to be a trusted pair of hands. </p>

      Cultivate helped us to distill our unique requirements down, and define was needed to deliver  a replacement system in 6 weeks. The new system is highly focused, simpler to use than it’s predecessor and delivers all the functionality we required. Cultivate delivered exactly what was needed, on time and within budget. They spent the time with us early in the project to completely understand what was required, then worked closely with us to build the solution.

      Cultivate were originally brought in not only to provide outsourced development support but work very closely with the in-house development team, so much so that they could be considered an in-house team themselves. It is the team's collaborative and friendly culture that allowed them to achieve this with ease.

      <h2>How do we work?</h2>
      <h3>We are remote, but connected.</h3>
      <p>Being based in Edinburgh, we were engaged from the beginning as a remote team. Remote working is a skill ingrained in the Cultivate culture and ethos. It requires extra effort to be ‘present’ which we work hard to achieve.</p>
      <p>We maintain our connection with regular communication:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Daily standups</li>
        <li>Nightly emails with a burn-up chart showing progress</li>
        <li>Weekly demo &amp; planning sessions </li>
        <li>Regular retrospectives</li>
        <li>Monthly onsite visits</li>
        <li>Always available online via Slack, Trello and VOIP</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We were recently recognised for our collaboration and communication, winning ‘Best Supporting Agency’ at the 2015 MAS Digital Awards. </p>

      <h2>Handed over, but never 'thrown over the wall'.</h2>
      <p>Our primary role is currently kick-starting new projects. To be able to do so, when the time is right, we hand over development to an internal team. We deliver well documented, fully tested, high quality, clean code, deployed and ready for ongoing development. </p>

      I can highly recommend the services provided by Cultivate. I only hope that I get to work with other development companies that are as talented, professional and easy to work with.
