        <h2>Facilitating Discussions</h2>
        <p>At the beginning of a project, we specialise in facilitating discussions around product vision with business and customer needs at their core. We'll work with you to define success in measurable terms, and explore potential solutions to help you and your customers achieve that success. We'll surface assumptions and realities, ensuring that the team is aligned to build the best possible product.</p>
        <p>Throughout delivery, we'll advocate for your customers, bringing the best out of your teams with expertise in product ownership and project management, ensuring that proposed solutions fit with genuine customer needs.</p>

          I've worked with the folks at Cultivate first hand. While they excel at agile product development, where they really shine is in striving to continually understand changing client and customer needs and incorporating those learnings, in real time, into their work. This results not only in products built and designed well but also ones that demonstrably impact their clients' businesses.

          Seeing it come to life so quickly kept everyone motivated and built huge confidence. The stakeholders were stunned that we could show them working software on day two. They were used to seeing powerpoint slides and photoshop mockups for the first three steering meetings.
