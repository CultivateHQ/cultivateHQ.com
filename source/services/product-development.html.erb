          Cultivate helped us to distill our unique requirements down, and define was needed to deliver a replacement system in 6 weeks. The new system is highly focused, simpler to use than it’s predecessor and delivers all the functionality we required. Cultivate delivered exactly what was needed, on time and within budget. They spent the time with us early in the project to completely understand what was required, then worked closely with us to build the solution.

          I've worked with the folks at Cultivate first hand. While they excel at agile product development, where they really shine is in striving to continually understand changing client and customer needs and incorporating those learnings, in real time, into their work. This results not only in products built and designed well but also ones that demonstrably impact their clients' businesses.

          The collaboration with Cultivate was instrumental in building a culture of remote collaboration which we expanded across our whole engineering team. They integrated to our practices while also rubbing off on our engineers. The project was a success, and we came out with a better team than when we started!
