      <p>Our team have been part of the Ruby community for many years, building a strong reputation for quality. We've been building <a href="/services/software-development/ruby-on-rails/">Ruby on Rails</a> applications since 2009, when we operated as the Edinburgh office of EdgeCase, a software development studio with a passion for craftsmanship.</p>

      <p>We have years of experience helping <a href="/clients/">clients of all sizes</a> build well-engineered, scalable applications. We can guide you through the <a href="/services/product-development/">creation of a brand new product</a>, but are equally comfortable supporting high performance teams on some of the worldâ€™s largest applications.</p>

      Where most consultancies expect specs to be thrown over the fence, the Cultivate engineers truly became part of our team. The collaboration with Cultivate was instrumental in building a culture of remote collaboration which we expanded across our whole engineering team. They integrated to our practices while also rubbing off on our engineers. The project was a success, and we came out with a better team then when we started!
