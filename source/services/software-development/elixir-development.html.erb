      <h2>Experience</h2>
      <p>Our team have many years of experience successfully delivering complex web applications for <a href="/clients/">our clients</a>. We're already using Elixir on <a href="/clients/case-studies/38-degrees">live client projects</a> and can partner with you to make the most of Elixir for your next project.</p>

      <h2>Future Proof</h2>
      <p>We believe the combination of Phoenix, Ecto and Elixir is the the future of web applications. While Phoenix is just as productive as Rails it has a more scalable philosophy. Out of the box, Phoenix in Umbrella Applications give us a great framework for organising the structure of our projects, ready to grow with our clientsâ€™ needs. The amazing power and resilience of OTP is there when we need it.</p>
      <h2>Community, Talks and Blog Posts</h2>
      <p>We are proud sponsors of Elixir London Conference, Elixir Conf EU and Code Sync - Code Elixir, and look forward to being part of the community as it grows and develops.</p>
      <p>Our very own Alan Gardner (<a href="https://twitter.com/mr_urf">@mr_urf</a>) spoke at ElixirConf 2015 on combining the Phoenix web framework with the Elm programming language. You can watch the talk below or check out <a href="/posts/phoenix-elm-1/">our in-depth tutorial</a> in our blog.</p>
      <p>Paul Wilson (<a href="https://twitter.com/paulanthonywils">@paulanthonywils</a>), our Managing Director  recently gave a talk about using Elixir and Nerves at ElixirConfEU 2016. You can also find his talk below.</p>
