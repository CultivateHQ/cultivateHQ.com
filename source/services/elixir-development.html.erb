      <p>Cultivate have been excited by the potential of Elixir since its creation. We believe Phoenix to be the next Ruby on Rails as it provides the same ‘get started quickly’ qualities of Rails, with the added value of concurrency at it’s core. It also benefits from lower server resource requirements making scaling easier and cheaper, excellent fault tolerance and web-sockets baked in - a framework suitable for the modern web.</p>
      <p>This makes Elixir the ideal choice for building anything from mobile consumable APIs to fully fledged web applications, and even embedded systems.</p>
      <p>Elixir is build on top of the battle tested Erlang VM, which was created for use in the telecoms industry, a sector requiring notoriously high throughput and real time processing of data. These properties make it an excellent choice for future-proofed development of your next project.</p>
      <p>Our very own Alan Gardner (<a href="https://twitter.com/mr_urf">@mr_urf</a>) spoke at ElixirConf 2015 on combining the Phoenix web framework with the Elm programming language. You can watch the talk and check out our in-depth tutorial in links below.</p>
