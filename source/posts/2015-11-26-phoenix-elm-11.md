<section class="callout">
  I gave [a talk at ElixirConf 2015](http://confreaks.tv/videos/elixirconf2015-phoenix-with-elm) on combining the [Phoenix web framework](http://www.phoenixframework.org/) with the [Elm programming language](http://elm-lang.org). This is the tutorial that was referred to in that talk.

  The tutorial walks through the creation of a very basic seat saving application, like one you'd use when booking a flight for example. The application will do just enough to demonstrate the mechanisms for getting the two technologies talking to each other.

  There is an [accompanying repo](https://github.com/CultivateHQ/seat_saver) for this tutorial. Each of the numbered steps has an associated commit so that you can just look at the diffs if you'd rather not read through the whole thing.

## Introducing Phoenix channels

We took a look, in [Part 9](/posts/phoenix-elm-9), at how to fetch our initial seat data via an HTTP request. However, one of the most compelling reasons to use Phoenix is because of it's first class support for [Channels](http://www.phoenixframework.org/docs/channels). Channels are a way to communicate with our Phoenix application in realtime across an open connection. They fit our Elm architecture well as they are all about the flow of data.


## But first ...

Before we start, let's rewind our efforts from [Part 9](/posts/phoenix-elm-9). We don't need most of the code that we added and it could serve to confuse things. We can re-add what we do need when we need it.

If you created a branch in your own version of the project then you can just dump it, or do whatever you need to do to get back to the pre-HTTP state.

If you can't do that, then checking out the [pre-http](https://github.com/CultivateHQ/seat_saver/tree/pre-http) branch of the SeatSaver repo should get you to where you need to be.


### Creating a channel

We'll start by creating a channel and then look at how to join that channel. We'll wrap things up for this part by fetching our initial seat data over that channel.

1. Phoenix has a built-in mix generator for creating channels, so let's use that.

    ```shell
    mix phoenix.gen.channel Seat seats
    ```

2. This gives us a number of files, some of which we will need to now tweak to suit our use case. Start by updating *web/channels/user_socket.ex* to create a channel with a topic:subtopic of `seats:planner` that points to our newly generated SeatChannel module.

    ```elixir
    defmodule SeatSaver.UserSocket do
      use Phoenix.Socket

      ## Channels
      # channel "rooms:*", SeatSaver.RoomChannel
      channel "seats:planner", SeatSaver.SeatChannel

      ...
    end
    ```

3. Now open that SeatChannel module in file *web/channels/seat_channel.ex* and update the `join` function to have the same topic:subtopic pair.

    ```elixir
    defmodule SeatSaver.SeatChannel do
      use SeatSaver.Web, :channel

      def join("seats:planner", payload, socket) do
        ...
      end

      ...
    end
    ```

4. Finally update the associated test in *test/channels/seat_channel_test.exs* to also have that topic:subtopic pair.

    ```elixir
    defmodule SeatSaver.SeatChannelTest do
      ...

      setup do
        {:ok, _, socket} =
          socket("user_id", %{some: :assign})
          |> subscribe_and_join(SeatChannel, "seats:planner")

       ...
      end

      ...

      test "shout broadcasts to seats:planner", %{socket: socket} do
        ...
      end

      ...
    end
    ```

5. You can check to see if everything has worked as expected by running `mix test` (you should have 7 passing tests).


### Joining the channel

Now that we have a channel, we need to set things up on the client side to connect to the channel.

1. Open the *web/static/js/socket.js* file and change the topic:subtopic to `seats:planner` on line 57.

    ```javascript
    ...

    socket.connect()

    // Now that you are connected, you can join channels with a topic:
    let channel = socket.channel("seats:planner", {})

    ...
    ```

2. Now open *web/static/js/app.js* and uncomment line 21.

    ```javascript
    import socket from "./socket"
    ```

3. If you visit <http://localhost:4000> and check the web console, you should see `Joined successfully`.

### Getting initial seat data

Let's now fetch the initial seat data from the database and make it available to the client. Before we can get the initial data we need to store it in the database.

1. Let's start by creating a Seat model.

    ```shell
    mix phoenix.gen.model Seat seats seat_no:integer occupied:boolean
    ```

2. Then migrate the database.

    ```shell
    mix ecto.migrate
    ```

    <section class="callout">
      *Please note*: if you see the following error, it is because you will have created the seats table already during [Part 9](/posts/phoenix-elm-9). You can either skip this step or, if you want a clean slate, drop the table in psql (or your Postgres tool of choice).
      <br>
      <br>
      <code>
        (Postgrex.Error) ERROR (duplicate_table): relation "seats" already exists
      </code>
      <br>
      <br>
      Thanks to Libby (@emhoracek) for raising this as an issue. :)
    </section>

3. Let's run the generated tests with `mix test` to ensure that we haven't broken anything so far. We should have 9 passing tests.
4. We can use the *priv/repo/seeds.exs* file to populate some seat data for us, same as we did in [Part 9](/posts/phoenix-elm-9). Add the following to the end of that file (note that the first two seats are occupied but the rest are not):

    ```elixir
    SeatSaver.Repo.insert!(%SeatSaver.Seat{seat_no: 1, occupied: true})
    SeatSaver.Repo.insert!(%SeatSaver.Seat{seat_no: 2, occupied: true})
    SeatSaver.Repo.insert!(%SeatSaver.Seat{seat_no: 3, occupied: false})
    SeatSaver.Repo.insert!(%SeatSaver.Seat{seat_no: 4, occupied: false})
    SeatSaver.Repo.insert!(%SeatSaver.Seat{seat_no: 5, occupied: false})
    SeatSaver.Repo.insert!(%SeatSaver.Seat{seat_no: 6, occupied: false})
    SeatSaver.Repo.insert!(%SeatSaver.Seat{seat_no: 7, occupied: false})
    SeatSaver.Repo.insert!(%SeatSaver.Seat{seat_no: 8, occupied: false})
    SeatSaver.Repo.insert!(%SeatSaver.Seat{seat_no: 9, occupied: false})
    SeatSaver.Repo.insert!(%SeatSaver.Seat{seat_no: 10, occupied: false})
    SeatSaver.Repo.insert!(%SeatSaver.Seat{seat_no: 11, occupied: false})
    SeatSaver.Repo.insert!(%SeatSaver.Seat{seat_no: 12, occupied: false})
    ```

5. Run `mix run priv/repo/seeds.exs` to apply the seeds.
6. We're really only interested in the `seat_no` and `occupied` fields. Furthermore, we want to use camel case for the `seat_no` field when it is used in JSON data. We can do this by implementing the Poison Encoder protocol. Add the following to the bottom of your *web/models/seat.ex* file, after the end of the definition SeatSaver.Seat module.

    ```elixir
    defimpl Poison.Encoder, for: SeatSaver.Seat do
      def encode(model, opts) do
        %{id: model.id,
          seatNo: model.seat_no,
          occupied: model.occupied} |> Poison.Encoder.encode(opts)
      end
    end
    ```

7. Now change the `join` function in the *web/channels/seat_channel.ex* file to call `send self(), :after_join` on successful authorization, like this:

    ```elixir
    def join("seats:planner", payload, socket) do
      if authorized?(payload) do
        send self(), :after_join
        {:ok, socket}
      else
        {:error, %{reason: "unauthorized"}}
      end
    end
    ```

    <div class="callout">
      <p>
        If you've watched the video for the talk that accompanies this tutorial, you'll notice a difference in approach here. In the talk I supplied the seat data directly from the <code>join</code> function.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since then I was informed by Claudio Ortolina (@cloud8421) that this is not the preferred approach, but rather that a message is sent to <code>self</code> that instructs the data to be sent. This helps keep the client code clean. The code that deals with joining a channel is not also responsible for fetching the initial state, and the code that deals with fetching the initial state can be reused by the client-side application if required without having to worry about the join code.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sending <code>self()</code> a message inside a channel results in a call to function called <code>handle_info/2</code>.
      </p>
    </div>

8. Let's add the required `handle_info` function (also to the *web/channels/seat_channel.ex* file) with the following definition:

    ```elixir
    def handle_info(:after_join, socket) do
      seats = (from s in SeatSaver.Seat, order_by: [asc: s.seat_no]) |> Repo.all
      push socket, "set_seats", %{seats: seats}
      {:noreply, socket}
    end
    ```

9. Add the following to your *web/static/js/socket.js* file anywhere above the `export default socket` line:

    ```javascript
    channel.on('set_seats', data => {
      console.log('got seats', data.seats)
    })
    ```

10. If you go to <http://localhost:4000> in your browser and open the console, you should see the following:

    ![Initial seat data in the console](/images/phoenix-elm/16.png)


### Getting seat data into Elm

Now that we have data being sent to the client over our channel after we've joined it, we'll want to pull that data into our Elm application so that we can use it to initialize our model.

Open the *web/elm/SeatSaver.elm* file and do the following:

1. Change the `init` function to set the model to an empty List, like so:

    ```haskell
    init : (Model, Effects Action)
    init =
      ([], Effects.none)
    ```

2. In order to get data in and out of Elm we use a mechanism called [ports](http://elm-lang.org/guide/interop#ports). Add the following port to a signals section at the bottom of the file.

    ```haskell
    -- SIGNALS

    port seatLists : Signal Model
    ```

    Sending a message to an incoming port will place the data on a Signal (we looked at Signals in [Part 7](/posts/phoenix-elm-7)). In our case we want to pass in a List of Seat records, in other words our Model.

3. If you go to <http://localhost:4000> in your browser you will see the following error:

    ![port error](/images/phoenix-elm/17.png)

4. Ports need to be initialized with a starting value. This is because the port is a Signal and Signals need to have a starting value. We can do this by giving our port an initial value in *web/static/js/app.js*

    ```javascript
    var elmDiv = document.getElementById('elm-main')
      , initialState = {seatLists: []}
      , elmApp = Elm.embed(Elm.SeatSaver, elmDiv, initialState);
    ```

5. Now if you check the browser you should see

    ![initialized port](/images/phoenix-elm/18.png)

6. OK, so we are now initializing our model to be an empty List and we have created a port through which we can send our seat data. Now we need to send that data through the port. To make it easier to work with, let's move our channel code through from *web/static/js/socket.js* to *web/static/js/app.js*

    ```javascript
    let channel = socket.channel("seats:planner", {})
    channel.join()
      .receive("ok", resp => { console.log("Joined successfully", resp) })
      .receive("error", resp => { console.log("Unable to join", resp) })

    channel.on('set_seats', data => {
      console.log('got seats', data.seats)
    })
    ```

7. We can send our seat data to this port as follows:

    ```javascript
    channel.on('set_seats', data => {
      console.log('got seats', data.seats)
      elmApp.ports.seatLists.send(data.seats)
    })
    ```

    Elm will automatically convert our JSON data into an Elm List for us if it can match the structure of the data passed into a type that it knows about. This is why we converted our `seat_no` Elixir field into the camel case version `seatNo` when outputting as JSON. Elm will recognise our JSON as a List of Seat records and convert it accordingly before placing it on the Signal.

8. Looking at the browser again we still see no seat data. This is because we need to get the data from the port into StartApp so that it can be sent to our `update` function.

    ![still no seats](/images/phoenix-elm/18.png)

9. So let's get this data along to our `update` function. In order to pass the data into StartApp we need to put it on a Signal with values of type Action. We can do this using the `Signal.map` function. This converts every value on a given Signal to a different type on another Signal. In our Signals section add the following:

    ```haskell
    incomingActions: Signal Action
    incomingActions =
      Signal.map SetSeats seatLists
    ```

    This is shorthand for the following:

    ```haskell
    incomingActions: Signal Action
    incomingActions =
      Signal.map (\seatList -> SetSeats seatList) seatLists
    ```

    In other words, for every value on the `seatLists` Signal, convert it into a SetSeats Action with that value as its argument, and place it on the `incomingActions` Signal.

11. Now we can add this Signal of Action as an input to our StartApp initializer in our `app` function.

    ```haskell
    app =
      StartApp.start
        { init = init
        , update = update
        , view = view
        , inputs = [incomingActions]
        }
    ```

12. And then add the `SetSeats` action to the `update` function

    ```haskell
    type Action = Toggle Seat | SetSeats Model


    update : Action -> Model -> (Model, Effects Action)
    update action model =
      case action of
        Toggle seatToToggle ->
          ...
        SetSeats seats ->
          (seats, Effects.none)
    ```

    Because the seats that we pass in here are a List of Seats, aka a Model, we can just do a straight swap with the existing model. Thus we turn our current Model (an empty list) into a new Model (our given List of Seat records). We have no further action to take and so we have a no-op Effect.

13. Checking the browser you should now see all of the seat data passed through.

    ![yay seat data](/images/phoenix-elm/19.png)

And there we have it! We are now fetching our seat data over a Phoenix channel.

## Summary

We're now fetching the initial seat data using channels rather than HTTP request/response. In [part 12](/posts/phoenix-elm-12) we'll deal with toggling a seat from available to occupied (and vice versa) over channels.
