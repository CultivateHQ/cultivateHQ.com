We're currently engaged on a project which requires some research into people who like to go on recreational walks (hikes / hill walks / rambles). We would especially like to talk to people in the next 7 days (16 to 22 Feb). If that's you, we'd love to have a few minutes chat either in person (Edinburgh or Glasgow) by telephone, or online (Skype/Hangout/Talky). In return we can give you a gift (travel cannister, rrp Â£25).
