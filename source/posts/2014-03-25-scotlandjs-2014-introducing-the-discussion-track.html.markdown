## Discussion Track
This year at [ScotlandJS](http://scotlandjs.com/) we are introducing the Discussion Track as an integral part of the event experience.

In the last few months a number of people have been questioning the traditional conference format where speakers share their knowledge and experience from the stage. Many people specifically attend events to learn from other delegates whom they randomly strike up a conversation with in the hallway between talks, this is what we want to amplify. At [ScotlandJS](http://scotlandjs.com/) this year we aim to provide a means that allows you to get the best of both formats.


## How will the Discussion Track work?
The discussions will be facilitated, given direction and cover multiple topics.

### Facilitation:
Alan Gardner and Matt Wynne have very kindly offered to facilitate these sessions, which will be delivered in a Lean Coffee format (without the coffee). Here participants submit items for discussion then collectively vote on which to discuss.

#### Direction:
[ScotlandJS](http://scotlandjs.com/) has 23 talks chosen by ticket holders. These are the topics that our delegates are most interested in and will provide the subject matter for the Discussion Track.

After a speaker finishes their talk, those with questions or wishing to discuss the subject matter further move over to the Discussion Track. Then during the next speaking slot the discussion will take place.

All videos will be made available after the event if there is a clash between what you want to see and what you want to talk about.

## What should I expect during the Discussion track?
Our aim here is to provide a means for you to discover the relationships that will provide the greatest shared value to your continued development and thereby the communities beyond [ScotlandJS](http://scotlandjs.com/).

You come to an event like [ScotlandJS](http://scotlandjs.com/) to learn from speakers and your peers.

Whether you have just started programming in JavaScript, or the author of a HUGE front end framework, every ones contribution is valued.

* Let's embrace beginners and help them level up.
* Question the speakers and their thinking.
* Advance the tech that we currently have and embrace the vast diversity of the JS community and learn from one another.

Personally, when I started writing Ruby full time and began attending events there was this one guy that was an AMAZING speaker. Always overflowing with enthusiasm and pleased to meet everyone. I was in awe and terrified to speak to him and I used his software everyday.

When I finally plucked up the courage to ask a question Jim was only to happy to help with a number of examples to help me get my head round eigen/meta/singleton classes. He always had a friendly encouraging word and huge smile every time he met you.

Everyone has the person that they look up to. I want to try and lessen any anxiety involved in the 'star struck' or shy mindset for delegates and speakers alike by making everyone accessible.

The Discussion Track can be a great way to break the ice and set in place a number of items for conversation later in the event, or in the future.

Further more I would like to mention some of the great qualities that Jim embodied that I would like those attending to aspire to in their life and work:

* Kind,
* Patient,
* an Active Listener,
* Modest,
* Enthusiastic,
* Non-judgemental,
* Joyful,
* and generous with knowledge and experience.

In summary, we are aiming to advance learning, JavaScript and the community by focusing on enabling it's greatest strength, People.

Be you shy, outgoing, young, old, designer, developer, beginner, intermediate or advanced your voice matters and YOU can always improve.

I truly believe we have a great opportunity to grow and learn together, let's make the most of it.

Thanks

Peter Aitken
