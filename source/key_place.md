# Key Place


Ever used a website that prompts you for the 3rd, 8th, and 12th character of your password, only to spend the next few moments trying to work out what password you use, and counting what each of the required characters?

Key Place solves this problem. Key Place securely protects these partial passwords on your iPhone, and provides a quick and simple way to fetch ordinal characters.

## Getting started

Key Place is straightforward to use. On first use, you will be asked to set a master password. This master password will be used to securely encrypt your stored partial passwords.

Of course, you should use something hard to guess and fairly complex. We also insist that it is at least 8 characters long. Mixing in numbers and punctation will make it harder to crack.

## Entering your master password

You will be asked for your master password when launching the application, or if it has been in the background for more than 60 seconds.

If you get it wrong, there is a slight delay before you can try again. The delay doubles each time you get it wrong, to make it hard for someoene to guess your password.

## Add passwords

Add the partial passwords you want to remember, using the + button on the top right of the main application screen.

## Using a password

When you need to use a password (or pass number), just select it from the list to show the _display password_ screen. Tap the keys _in the order requested_.

You can edit a password by selecting "edit" from the _display password_ screen.

You can also delete a password from the _edit_ screen.

Alternatively you can delete a password from the main screen, by swiping from right to left.

## Security

Your master password is used to securely encrypt the stored the partial passwords and pass numbers on your iPhone. We use [AES encryption](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard), with random [salts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography) and [initialization vectors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initialization_vector).

The master password itself is stretched, salted, and securely hashed before being stored in Apple's secure keychain. We take the password security very seriously.
