Ballpark is a tool to help conference or other ticketed event organisers plan and project costings. Our team have been running a number of community conferences for several years now, and this product is an outcome from solving a burning pain we've personally experienced when trying to organise events.

Ballpark is free to use, and is used by a number of conference organisers globally.
