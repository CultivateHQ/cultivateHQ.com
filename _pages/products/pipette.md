Pipette is a simple, quick to use app to help designers and developers quickly work with colours.
Designed for OS X, Pipette is an ideal companion application for developers & designers who need
to quickly find Hex & RGB colour values from an on screen colour picker.

Pipette also features the ability to output a desired colour in the format used to add colours to
Swift-based iOS applications, making it ideal for an iOS developer's workflow.
