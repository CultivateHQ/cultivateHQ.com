      <p>Secret Earth is a trip planning website, offering selective recommendations from the world’s top travel writers, itinerary planning and price comparison tools.</p>
      <p>
      Cultivate worked collaboratively with the site’s founders during its early days. We were involved in the design and development of key features of the application, creating a number of bespoke tools.

      Cultivate really helped us to kick-start our project by establishing a way of working and the technology platform from which we could independently drive our developments. Along the way we have benefited from their continued support and to this day we still refer to them for guidance in both user and technology product developments.
