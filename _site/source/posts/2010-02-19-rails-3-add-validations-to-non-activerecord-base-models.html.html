<p>Prior to Rails 3, if you wanted to add validations to models which didn’t inherit from <code>ActiveRecord::Base</code>, you’d probably resort to using a gem/plugin that re-implements much of the behaviour or has some dirty hooks into the ActiveRecord private API.</p>

<p>Now, the ActiveRecord internals have been re-written as modules and pushed out into the ActiveModel gem. ActiveRecord still uses these modules, only now, it is relatively straight forward to use the same logic in other classes.</p>

<p>Below is a basic sample you can tryout in an irb session which includes the <code>ActiveModel::Validations</code> module:</p>

<p>```ruby
require ‘active_model’</p>

<p>class Place
  include ActiveModel::Validations
  validates_presence_of :name
  attr_accessor :name
end</p>

<p>place = Place.new
place.valid?
#&gt; false</p>

<p>place.name = “le pub”
place.valid?
#&gt; true
```</p>

<p>For any applications which require non-persisting models, or even models that don’t use ActiveRecord, it’s now a whole lot easier to introduce AR conventions without any pain.</p>
