<p>In the event you need to tear down your elasticsearch index, there is a web API that you can take
advantage of to make this fairly straight forward:</p>

<p><code>bash
curl http://localhost:9200/_mapping
&gt; {"app_name":{"resource": {"123": "some-value"}}}
</code></p>

<p>Making a GET request like the one above, where <code>localhost:9200</code> is the web interface of your elasticsearch
server, will return a mapping of all the indexes currently available on the server. To delete a specific mapping,
simply send a DELETE request to the server with the path to the index tacked on to the URL. eg.</p>

<p><code>bash
curl -XDELETE http://localhost:9200/app_name/resource/123
</code></p>

<p>or to delete a parent index and associated child indexes:</p>

<p><code>bash
curl -XDELETE http://localhost:9200/app_name
</code></p>
