<p>This is the first post in a series of posts focusing on accessibility and user experience considerations when developing for the web.</p>

<p>I’m kicking this off with a post demonstrating what a screen reader user experiences.</p>

<h2 id="why-a-blog-post-on-screen-readers">Why a blog post on screen readers?</h2>
<p>Knowing that screen readers exist and people use them, to actually become a screen reader user turned out to be an enlightening experience. I found that tasks which are normally relatively straight-forward, suddenly become just that little bit more tedious. Sometimes things can even be quite difficult to do. In worse-case scenarios, they can simply just be not possible to do.</p>

<p>My journey with screen readers began at the tail-end of last year while working on projects where screen reader accessibility was a requirement. Up until that point, I thought I had a pretty good handle on many aspects of web development including accessibility. Turned out I actually had quite a gap in my knowledge. For a bit of context, I’ve been making things for the web for about 15 years now, back when <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape">Netscape</a> was a thing, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_Application_Protocol">WAP</a> and smart phones were becoming a thing. And <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynx_(web_browser)">Lynx</a> was that thing (and still is) to see how a text-only user / web scraper might see your site. Catering for different types of browsers; small screen sizes; or text only readers is one thing. To add in screen readers, requires some additional consideration for your users.</p>

<p>It’s hard to describe some of the situations without going into detailed examples. So to get started, it’s easier to fire up a screen reader and see for yourself the types of issues people encounter. I’ve created a short video just to show a comparison of trying to get to some latest sporting news as a normal user, to trying to acheive the same task with just a screen reader.</p>

<p>In the VoiceOver example from the video, you can see that by just having it enabled, the extra actions and the time to complete a task can become a bit of a frustrating experience. Now consider a process that requires a user to spend a few minutes filling in forms or navigating a substantial amount of content. Anything that can be done to reduce pain points and make things faster and easier for users, to me, is a worthwhile thing to be doing.</p>

<p>Here is quick rundown of some screen readers and some helpful links to point you in the direction of getting started with them.</p>

<h2 id="mobile-screen-readers">Mobile Screen Readers</h2>

<h3 id="ios">iOS</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/accessibility/ios/voiceover/">VoiceOver</a> - Standard screen reader that is provided by apple. It’s free, already on your device and just needs to be enabled to use.</p>

<h3 id="android">Android</h3>
<p><a href="https://support.google.com/accessibility/android">Talkback</a> - This is the main screen reader for Android that is likely to already be installed on your device. If not, you can get it from the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.marvin.talkback">Google Play store</a>.</p>

<p>It’s worth noting that depending on your Android device and OS version, the user experience of TalkBack can be a bit different. We’re fortunate to have <a href="http://www.devicelab.org">device lab</a> in the same building as us which makes testing devices quite convenient. If you have access to a device testing lab, it is worth booking a short amount of time just to test out different devices for the experience.</p>

<h2 id="desktop-screen-readers">Desktop Screen Readers</h2>

<h3 id="apple-mac-os-x">Apple Mac OS X</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/accessibility/osx/voiceover/">VoiceOver</a> - This screen reader is build into every mac – no installation required. To enable it, you’ll find it within ‘System Preferences &gt; Accessibility’. This is the screen reader I’ve mainly been using for testing purposes.</p>

<h3 id="windows">Windows</h3>
<p>For Windows machines, there are a number of free and paid-for products:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.freedomscientific.com/Products/Blindness/JAWS">JAWS</a> - This screen reader has been around for a number of years and from what I can tell, is possibly the most popular screen reader on the market.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nvaccess.org">NVDA</a> - Another screen reader that has been around for a while, except is a free piece of software.</p>

<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hear-text-read-aloud-narrator#1TC=windows-8">Narrator</a> - Like OS X, Windows 8 ships with it’s own built-in screen reader. I’ve not seen it used as a screen reader for accessibility reports. This is not to disregard it, as it may still be useful to test with it for an alternative perspective.</p>

<h3 id="linux">Linux</h3>
<p><a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/action/show/Projects/Orca?action=show&amp;redirect=Orca">Orca</a> - I’ve not had an opportunity to test screen readers on linux yet, but <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Web_applications_and_ARIA_FAQ">Mozilla documentation</a> on <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/">ARIA</a> support, lists Orca with Firefox as a possibility to try.</p>

<p>Here is a more comphrensive <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_screen_readers">wikipedia article</a> listing available screen readers and what operating systems they work on.</p>

<h2 id="what-next">What Next?</h2>
<p>So hopefully from reading this and watching my short video demo, I’ve intrigued you enough to go and have a play with a screen reader just to get a feel for how much effort is actually required for a user.</p>

<p>As a final tip, before you enable any of the built-in screen readers. It’s worth taking a couple of minutes to read the documentation on how to navigate with the screen reader and it disable the reader if you need to!</p>
