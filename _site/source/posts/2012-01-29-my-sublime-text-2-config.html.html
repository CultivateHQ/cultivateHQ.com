<p>Sublime Text 2 has been my editor of choice for about a year now. It’s a great piece of software, but gradually I’ve been adding my own config options to make it just that little bit nicer for working with on a daily basis. I like it, and the guys in the office like it enough that it’s the default config on our pairing machines at the moment.</p>

<h2 id="launching-sublime-from-the-command-line">Launching Sublime from the command-line</h2>
<p>Sublime comes with a command-line tool named subl. For convenience, create a symlink to a directory that is in your <code>$PATH</code>. I have <code>/usr/local/bin</code> in my path, so I have a symlink that allows me to use <code>sublime some_file.txt</code>:</p>

<p><code>bash
ln -s "/Applications/Sublime Text 2.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl" /usr/local/bin/sublime
</code></p>

<h2 id="bash">Bash</h2>
<p>If you want to make Sublime your default editor for things like git commit messages etc. Drop this into <code>~/.profile</code>:</p>

<p><code>bash
export EDITOR='sublime -w'
</code></p>

<h2 id="user-preferences">User Preferences</h2>
<p>A summary of my preferences:
Soft tabs, 2 characters wide; White on Black text theme; Auto save when window loses focus; Trim unwanted whitespace.</p>

<p>Add the following snippet to <code>Preferences -&gt; File Settings - User</code>:</p>

<p><code>python
{
  "color_scheme": "Packages/Color Scheme - Default/Twilight.tmTheme",
  "font_face": "Monaco",
  "font_size": 12,
  "draw_white_space": "selection",
  "trim_trailing_white_space_on_save": true,
  "tab_size": 2,
  "translate_tabs_to_spaces": true,
  "tab_completion": true,
  "save_on_focus_lost": true,
  "highlight_line": true
}
</code></p>
